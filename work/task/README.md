# Tasks

## Naming convention

Use `NNN-short-description` for task folder names, e.g.:

```
001-add-sound-effects/
002-fix-ball-capture-bug/
```

## Creating a new task

1. Copy `_template/` to a new folder with the next number
2. Fill in `description.md` with summary, goals, and acceptance criteria
3. Add the task to `index.md`
4. Create an agent context file in `agents/` when starting work

## Task lifecycle

- **Active** — currently being worked on
- **Blocked** — waiting on something
- **Done** — completed and verified
